This is my public porfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course in Carnegie Mellon University

# About me
My name is Ankita Bhatnagar and my pronouns are she/her. I am a second-year MSIT (focus on Business Intelligence and Data Analytics) student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. This is my fifth semester, and I have learned so much in these past 1.5 years. I am super excited about Telling Stories with Data course along with the other two minis I have enrolled for. I work full time with Capgemini as a Business Intelligence Manager. I am pursuing a fully online MSIT at Carnegie Mellon and this program works for me perfectly.
During my 12 years of professional experience at Multi-National Companies like Accenture and Capgemini, I have worked on multiple projects in both India and the USA. I have analyzed and proposed solutions to several Business processes and implemented error-free software. I have a blend of both technical and leadership skills which I am sure will be productive to this course and act as a foundation to my curriculum. Working in India and the United States has taught me to value the background and experiences of each person.
I come from a land of richness and a country that beliefs in ‘unity in diversity’. In today’s world of a competitive market which has adopted the approach to global business solutions, I will have a lot to contribute to the mixed crowd of students from different cultures, values, thoughts, and economics. Throughout my life, I have had a diverse range of academics, work, and life experiences. I grew up in an environment of close-knit family ties in a small town called Rawatbhata, India. My father has been my inspiration throughout my life.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn techniques used by storytellers, documentarians, and artists to communicate findings about a dataset or situation. This course is an opportunity for me to brush up my sketching skills and also improve them. I hope to be able to evaluate and critique presentations and visuals created by others. I aim to learn techniques for finding a story in data, building data analysis skills. I expect to learn technique focused creation of sketches that tell data-driven stories with a rich set of digital and non-digital tools, online and offline. I also hope to learn how vizualization can be used to explore and discover features that often hide behind the data. A good part of this course will include various charts, plots, sequential narratives, treds and outliers, that seem exciting. 

# Portfolio
Here's where I plan on adding data visualizations that I will learn throughout the course and visual that I create in the future.

1. Visuals/Charts Critiques
2. Controlling colors
3. Lecture exercies

### Week2 Assignment: Visualizing government debt

#### Part 1: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/61L1" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/61L1" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2019</a></iframe>

#### Part 2: Working with Flourish

The assignments and readings from Week2 focused on Chart elements, color, typography, and cognition. For the two charts above, we worked on OECD data collected from https://data.oecd.org/. The data pertains to General Government debt across various countries through the span of years. This data is available for public use and contains data from 1995 through 2019. We used data for the year ranging from 1995 to 2018. We used the Flourish reporting studio tool to create these visuals.

The general government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator of the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions, and standardized guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits [1].

We have used three types of visualizations above.

The first visual (Part 1) is a bar graph that is available on the OECD Data website’s Featured charts. Each bar represents a country and the bars are arranged in ascending order of General government debt. The bar chart has a feature of changing color when it is clicked or selected in the settings.

The second graph (Part 2 - first graph) is a Line chart type of visualization. Each little graph represents an individual country. This plot type distinctly shows a comparison between various countries. If we had created a single line chart with one line for each country, it would have been a chaotic graph. If the cursor hovers over a particular country graph, the numbers are displayed for each year.
 
The third graph (Part 2 - second graph) is an Area chart type visualization. Similar to the line graph, each small visual shows a graph for an individual country. With an area chart, the visualization of the change of Government debt is better compared to the Line chart. The highlighted portion grabs the attention of a user towards the time and debt values. The comparison amongst individual countries is simpler in this chart type. For instance, the lines for Belgium and Canada are pretty close, however, the highlighted part comes into play in visualizing the difference.

Both these visuals will be able to successfully convey the message of General Government Debt for various countries in the last 23 years.
